# Queue

The Queue is a primitive datastructure. It uses the FIFO/LILO principle, which means the last element in will be the last element out. This can be imagined by a queue in a supermarket or a bank. Whoever comes the latest will have to wait until all members before have been taken care of first.
### Implementations
The queue is often being implemented as an array or arraylist. In our case we have decided for an arraylist.
### Operations
#### Put
The first major operation of a queue is to put a new element to the "tail" of the queue.
#### Get
The second and final major operation of a queue is to extract the next element of the queue out of its structure, in this case from its head.
